# -Sentiment analysis)IMDb Movie Reviews
In this project, I am applying natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to identify, analyze, and extract some important information from Movie review data. 
The main objective is to observe the reviewerâ€™s feelings, expressions, thoughts, or judgments about movies.
Sentiment Analysis can be done by machine learning. I have applied  three machine learning models.

SVM
Random Forest
